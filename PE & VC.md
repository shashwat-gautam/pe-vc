# Overview of Private Equity and Venture Capital

## What is Private Equity?

Private Equity firms are financial insitutions that invest their pool of funds in private companies. This type of financing is required by private companies as they are not listed in public markets (stock exchanges)and they need capital for expansion and working capital. 

These PE firms actively acquire and buyout the startups and private companies. On rare ocassions, they even buy the public companies and delist them. They act as strategic investors in companies that are relevant to their portfolio or vertical in which they operate. The structure of Private Equity is the same as Venture Capital which we will learn later. 

## What is Venture Capital?  

Venture Capital is essentially the best known category of Private Equity. The VC firms generally invest in startup companies that do not have a track record to raise in public markets and are in their initial stages.

## Working of a VC firm

The work of a Venture capital firm broadly covers two aspects:  

- Raising Capital from Investors
- Investing raised pool of money in startups

The Venture Capitalists are people working for the VC firm who decide where to invest the money. These VCs who run the firm are called the General Partners of the firm. The VC firms don't take interest on their investments. They take equity in the nascent stage startups in exchange for their investment and target high returns because of the high risk and uncertaintly involved. 

These VCs are generally very active in their investment approach and tend to participate with the company by acting as the director or advisor. The help to their portfolio companies is not restricted capitalwise, as they guide them to get customers through their connections and also provide them access to top laywers, consultants and accountants.
